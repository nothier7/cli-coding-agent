## 📋 Overall Assessment

Thierno, your "Terminal-Based Coding Agent" project demonstrates impressive architecture, clear modularity, and a strong alignment with the specified requirements around natural language programming, interactive CLI, safe execution, and file versioning. The REPL UX backed by clear diff previews and git-based undo is professional and developer-friendly. Your use of LLMs/structured intent parsing, sandbox abstraction, and memory/session handling are all quite robust. However, there are some critical areas to improve—particularly in comprehensive error handling, validating all external/AI-generated code, supporting persistent conversational context, and further strengthening sandbox security postures. Adding more automated tests, user-centric documentation, and finer-grained rollback/undo options will also boost maintainability and adoption.

## 📄 `main.py`

### 1. Line 117 🚨 **Critical Priority**

**📍 Location**: [main.py:117](https://github.com/nothier7/cli-coding-agent/blob/main/main.py#L117)

**💡 Feedback**: FUNCTIONALITY: Multi-turn context management is limited to previous user prompts, but the system does not maintain or persist agent (assistant) turns in the conversation history. This restricts LLMs from leveraging full interactive state, reducing context accuracy for consecutive instructions like "modify the last function". Persist both user and assistant turns in session memory and leverage them for LLM calls for true multi-turn conversational continuity. This will improve intent disambiguation and enable seamless workflow continuation.

### 2. Line 229 🔴 **High Priority**

**📍 Location**: [main.py:229](https://github.com/nothier7/cli-coding-agent/blob/main/main.py#L229)

**💡 Feedback**: SECURITY: Untrusted commands are executed in sandboxed or local environments after a single user confirmation, but there is no secondary static analysis nor dry-run for destructive shell operations. This increases risk of inadvertent or malicious file system/process modification, especially with commands like 'rm', 'mv', or indirect piped commands. Implement static validation of generated/suggested shell commands for potentially destructive operations, show a warning prompt, and consider a configurable "dry-run always on" safety switch for all high-risk commands. This will prevent data loss and align with robust agent safety standards.

### 3. Line 122 🟡 **Medium Priority**

**📍 Location**: [main.py:122](https://github.com/nothier7/cli-coding-agent/blob/main/main.py#L122)

**💡 Feedback**: FUNCTIONALITY: The CLI accepts only single-turn, non-interactive invocation with 'main.py <prompt>', and the richer REPL is implemented as a separate entry point. This splits user experience and hinders seamless adoption for newcomers who expect persistent sessions. Integrate full conversational REPL mode directly into the main orchestration, or detect interactive terminals to default to REPL, and add documented support for batch, script, and session-based use. This will unify user experience and lower the learning curve.

---

### 4. Line 171 🟡 **Medium Priority**

**📍 Location**: [main.py:171](https://github.com/nothier7/cli-coding-agent/blob/main/main.py#L171)

**💡 Feedback**: PERFORMANCE: Sandboxes are initialized for every invocation, even when only an intent parse or dry run is requested. This incurs unnecessary overhead, especially for cloud-based sandboxes. Lazy-initialize the sandbox only when an actual ":run_command" or file write is about to be performed, and close only after all operational steps complete (including error/abort). This will accelerate the parse/preview loop and is especially important for remote environments.

---

### 5. General 🚨 **Critical Priority**

**💡 Feedback**: TESTING: There are no automated unit or integration tests visible for the intent parsing, file operations, sandboxing, or planning modules. This risks regressions as new features or intent types are added. Add a "tests/" folder with pytest-based test cases for parsers, planners, and fs_ops; use golden files to check diff and patch correctness, and simulate LLM/model stubs for sequence validation. Improved test coverage reduces risk and is essential for safe maintenance.

---

### 6. Line 149 ⚪ **Low Priority**

**📍 Location**: [main.py:149](https://github.com/nothier7/cli-coding-agent/blob/main/main.py#L149)

**💡 Feedback**: QUALITY: On parsing errors, the agent attempts to print up to 4000 characters of failed LLM response, but the output may be noisy and hard to scan for debugging. Instead, log the error and save the full LLM output to a file, showing only a truncated or syntax-highlighted relevant snippet in the CLI. This will streamline troubleshooting and protect users from information overload.

---

## 📄 `patcher.py`

### 1. Line 11 🔴 **High Priority**

**📍 Location**: [patcher.py:11](https://github.com/nothier7/cli-coding-agent/blob/main/patcher.py#L11)

**💡 Feedback**: FUNCTIONALITY: The synthesis step relies entirely on model correctness and returns the first output as the full new file, but there is no automated or human-in-the-loop validation of the generated code before applying changes. This risks integrating incorrect, insecure, or even syntactically invalid code. Add post-synthesis code validation—such as Python linting if editing .py files (e.g., using ruff/flake8/black), and preview lint errors or parse failures before allowing write/commit. This improves reliability and developer trust in automated edits.

---

## 📄 `fs_ops.py`

### 1. General 🟡 **Medium Priority**

**💡 Feedback**: QUALITY: The file management layer is robust, with clear separation for reading, writing, and diffing, but lacks automated versioned snapshots outside of git commits or explicit rollback. Users are unable to recover intermediate file states between edits within a session. Implement an internal file snapshot or numbered backup history (.agent/backup/filename.timestamp.py) before every write_file operation, so any edit can be safely restored independently of git. This increases resilience and experimentation flexibility.

---

## 📄 `executor.py`

### 1. Line 39 🔴 **High Priority**

**📍 Location**: [executor.py:39](https://github.com/nothier7/cli-coding-agent/blob/main/executor.py#L39)

**💡 Feedback**: SECURITY: The subprocess invocation for command execution does not consider the possibility of argument injection if the 'args' list is constructed upstream from natural language or LLM output. If the LLM introduces an argument like '&& rm -rf /', the agent could unwittingly execute dangerous additional commands. Ensure all arguments are properly validated, use shlex.quote (when constructing command lines for interactive shell execution), and explicitly reject control characters and shell metacharacters in all user or AI-provided arguments. This protects against sophisticated shell-injection risk.

---

## 📄 `providers/e2b_sandbox.py`

### 1. Line 35 🔴 **High Priority**

**📍 Location**: [providers/e2b_sandbox.py:35](https://github.com/nothier7/cli-coding-agent/blob/main/providers/e2b_sandbox.py#L35)

**💡 Feedback**: SECURITY: The current E2B sandbox provider starts a new sandbox and runs any allowlisted command, but does not enforce resource limits (CPU, RAM, process count, network egress) or runtime isolation between agent sessions. If misconfigured, this could allow costly resource exhaustion or data exfiltration. Add explicit sandbox resource quotas via E2B API if possible, clearly document sandbox boundaries to users, and sanitize command inputs before forwarding remotely. This reduces blast radius both locally and in cloud sandboxes.

---

## 📄 `intents.py`

### 1. Line 16 ⚪ **Low Priority**

**📍 Location**: [intents.py:16](https://github.com/nothier7/cli-coding-agent/blob/main/intents.py#L16)

**💡 Feedback**: QUALITY: The 'args' field in the RunCommand pydantic model is initialized with a mutable default (an empty list), which can lead to subtle bugs due to shared references. Use Field(default_factory=list) to ensure each instance gets a separate list. This adheres to pydantic and Python best practices for mutables and prevents potential state leaks between intent instances.

---

## 📄 `planner.py`

### 1. Line 12 🔴 **High Priority**

**📍 Location**: [planner.py:12](https://github.com/nothier7/cli-coding-agent/blob/main/planner.py#L12)

**💡 Feedback**: FUNCTIONALITY: The planning layer does not check for the existence of the target file before planning a 'read_file' or code edit, which may result in developer confusion if editing a non-existent file. Guard edit_file and read_file steps with explicit existence checks and error annotations in the plan, allowing the CLI to inform the user proactively. This will provide clearer guidance and avoid hard-to-trace failures at execution time.

---

## 📄 `src/cherno/cli.py`

### 1. Line 54 ⚪ **Low Priority**

**📍 Location**: [src/cherno/cli.py:54](https://github.com/nothier7/cli-coding-agent/blob/main/src/cherno/cli.py#L54)

**💡 Feedback**: QUALITY: The REPL invokes main.py through a subprocess and loses direct access to rich console objects and prompt-toolkit features for advanced interactive feedback. Refactor to use either a unified driver or structured IPC for passing rich output and dynamic previews between REPL and agent core, making the REPL experience even more dynamic and error-resilient. This will unlock tighter integration and richer user experiences.

---

## 📄 `README.md`

### 1. General 🟡 **Medium Priority**

**💡 Feedback**: DOCUMENTATION: While the PKG-INFO and inline comments are strong, the absence of a top-level README.md means new users may miss quickstart, architecture, troubleshooting, or extensibility details found only in package metadata. Add a comprehensive README.md (as referenced in pyproject.toml) at the root for easy discovery. This aids onboarding and supports best OSS practices.
